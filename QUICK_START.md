# QUICK START GUIDE

## 🚀 Get Started in 2 Minutes

### What You Need
- Python 3.8 or higher
- The files in this directory

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (One-Time Setup)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Train the Model
```bash
python train_model.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- `heart_model.pkl` - Trained ensemble model (48MB)
- `scaler.pkl` - Feature scaler (1KB)
- `feature_info.pkl` - Feature metadata (321B)
- Performance metrics showing ~99% accuracy

**Time Required:** 2-3 minutes

### Step 3: Launch the Web App
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

**What Happens:**
- Browser opens automatically to http://localhost:8501
- Interactive web interface loads
- App is ready for predictions

### Step 4: Make Predictions
1. Enter patient medical data using sliders and dropdowns
2. Click "🔮 Generate Prediction"
3. View results instantly:
   - ✅ No Heart Disease / ⚠️ Heart Disease Detected
   - Confidence percentages
   - Risk assessment meter

## 📊 What Each File Does

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `train_model.py` | Trains the ensemble model - run this first |
| `streamlit_app.py` | Web app interface - run this second |
| `heart.csv` | Dataset (70,000 samples, 19 features) |
| `requirements.txt` | Python packages needed |
| `heart_model.pkl` | Trained model (created by train_model.py) |
| `scaler.pkl` | Feature scaler (created by train_model.py) |
| `feature_info.pkl` | Feature names (created by train_model.py) |

## ⚡ Model Performance

After training on 70,000 heart disease samples:

```
✓ Accuracy:   99.28%
✓ Precision:  99.37%
✓ Recall:     99.19%
✓ F1 Score:   99.28%
✓ AUC Score:  99.96%
```

**Models Used:**
- Logistic Regression (99.11% accuracy)
- Random Forest (99.11% accuracy)  
- XGBoost (99.21% accuracy)
- **Soft-Voting Ensemble (99.28% accuracy)**

---

## 🎯 How the Prediction Works

1. **You Enter:** Patient medical data (18 features)
2. **App Does:**
   - Scales features using same scaler from training
   - Runs through ensemble model
   - Gets probability from 3 classifiers
   - Averages predictions (soft-voting)
3. **You Get:** Binary result + confidence scores

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
**Solution:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### "heart_model.pkl not found"
**Solution:** Run `python train_model.py` first

### App shows "No Disease" for all inputs
**Solution:** The model files might be corrupted. Delete `.pkl` files and rerun `python train_model.py`

### Port 8501 already in use
**Solution:** Run `streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502`
